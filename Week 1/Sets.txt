A set is an unordered collection of strings that contain no duplicates.

Standard Operations:
    1. Intersection
    2. Union
    3. Difference

Commands:
SADD:
    SADD key member [member ...]
    Adds one or more members to a set
    O(N) to add N members

SCARD:
    SCARD key
    Returns the set cardinality
    O(1)

SDIFF:
    SDIFF key [key ...]
    Returns the difference of multiple sets
    O(N) where N is the total no. of elements in all given sets

SINTER:
    SINTER key [key ...]
    Returns the members of set resulting from intersection of all given sets
    O(N*M) worst case where N is the cardinality of smallest set and M is the number of sets

SISMEMBER:
    SISMEMBER key member
    Returns if a member belongs to a set
    O(1)

SMISMEMBER:
    SMISMEMBER key member [member ...]
    Returns whether each member belongs to a set
    O(N) where N is the number of elements being checked

SMEMBERS:
    SMEMBERS key
    Returns all members of a set
    O(N) where N is the set cardinality

SMOVE:
    SMOVE source destination member
    Move a member from source set to destination set
    O(1)

SPOP:
    SPOP key [count]
    Removes and returns one or more random members from set
    O(N) where is the value of count

SRANDMEMBER:
    SRANDMEMBER key [count]
    Returns random members from a set
    O(N) where N is absolute value of the passed count

SUNION:
    SUNION key [key ...]
    Returns the union of multiple sets
    O(N) where is N is the total number of elements in all given sets
